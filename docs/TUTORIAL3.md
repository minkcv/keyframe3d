# Tutorial 3

This tutorial explains how modifications can be made to an existing animation.

1. Download the scene that you want to modify.
2. Click 'Load Project' and load the project file.
3. Select the root node in the Scene Tree pane.
4. Enter a name for our new camera in the name field in the Scene Tree Controls pane.
5. Click Create Camera in the Scene Tree Controls pane.
6. Change the Set Camera field in the Controls Pane to the name of our new camera.
7. Click 'Seek Next Key Camera' in the controls pane.
8. Repeat steps 6 through 7 until you have set the key camera as our new camera for all keyframes.

From here you can move the camera around the scene for alternate views, or add more cameras and cut between them.
Making a camera the child of a scene element will cause the camera to follow that elements transform for the entire animation
